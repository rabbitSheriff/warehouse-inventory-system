The application was initially created by **Siamon Hasan**, useing [php](http:php.net), [mysql](https://www.mysql.com) and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).


I created this web application for beginner php programmer and who found difficulties to creating a inventory system.
This application more then 2 years old. I cleaned and modified few files. i also working on user and sales report section, when it's ready i will push it.

If you find any bug, and a fix for that bug, please leave a comment on the github page for this project and i will push the change into the master branch.

Installing this application is fairly easy, just follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version with git (`git clone https://github.com/siamon123/warehouse-inventory-system.git`)
